# OJJO
### By Ole Jacob Sletta & Johannes Ã˜stenby Moe
This project is about making a programming languange. 
We will build an interpreter not a compiler.
This language is named OJJ0 and will be build on the programming language c.
Our interpreter will take inn code as a string an interpret it. We have decided to build our own lexical analyzer.
